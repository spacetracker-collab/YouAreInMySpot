#### `SwipeableWidgetSlide` (meant for lower performance devices, like older Android devices)

- Demo of `SwipeableWidgetSlide` to be added

Check the [repository](https://github.com/ninest/swipeable_card) if you're unable to see the demo.

### App examples
Swipeable Widget is used in the following apps:
- [Shots](https://github.com/ninest/Shots)
- Create a PR to add your own!

## [üìí Documentation](https://swipeable-card.now.sh/)

### Installation
Add `swipeable_card` to your `pubspec.yaml`:

```
dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter

  # added below
  swipeable_card: <latest version>
```

### Adding to your app

The swipeable widget has to be placed in a `Column` (or `Row`), for example:

```
Column(
  children: <Widget>[
    SwipeableWidget(
      // parameters ...
      child: someChildWidget(),
    ),
  ],
)
```

In the above example, replace `someChildWidget()` with the widget that can be swiped (for example, a playing card-like widget).

Warning: while `SwipeableWidget` is fast on iPhones, it can be quite slow for older Android devices. I am currently working on `SwipeableWidgetSlide`, an alternative which can be used for older Android devices.

Check out [https://swipeable-card.now.sh/](https://swipeable-card.now.sh/) for the full documentation (still a work in progress).


## üòê Issues and limitations

If you use the a `swipeableWidgetController` to automatically swipe the cards (without the user panning), you can only start swiping the next card away when the previous one is fully swiped away. To see a demo, run the example, and continuously tap the "Left" button at the bottom of the screen.

Apart from that, all the other problems from v0.0.x seem to be dealth with.
